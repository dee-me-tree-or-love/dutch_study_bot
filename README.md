# Wordeu-Bot  
Wordeu is a tiny chatbot project for learning and practicing with new vocabulary.  
## Features  
### Learn new words
Tell Wordeu a new word you are learning (and tell him its translation too :wink:).  
Try `Hey, I am learning a new word 'wortel'` and answer `it translates as 'carrot'` next.  

### Practice your words  
Any time of the day you can ask Wordeu to give you a sample word to practice. 
Try asking him to `test me!` and try translating one of the words in your learning list. 

### Scores
_Disclaimer: this functionality will be imporved_
For each answer to the test you are awarded (or substracted) points of word knowledge.
The less mistakes you make, the better is your score! :v:

### Community based translations
The word base of Wordeu is enriched by every user.  
Your new translations of the known words will be added to the list!  
_Cliche_, but the more we talk with Wordeu, the smarter it gets 

### Availible on Messenger  
Wordeu can be reached via Messenger as @wordeu-bot. (Once approved :upside_down_face:)  

### Trying him out
#### Any time, any place  
If you would like to try Wordeu out, just jot him something on Facebook! 

#### You will help him improve  
Please, please, please do send me feedback from your experience with Wordeu! 
He is still quite young, so this will help to make him better a lot :smiley:
